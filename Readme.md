# Kodi Media Copy

## What?
it is a flask based webapp that produces a listing of media from a kodi media database
it allows to select media from the listing and mark it for copying
the site/media library owner can then use a simple cmdline tool to copy all marked media to a storage device
## Why?
remembering what my family/friends wanted to have from my media collection was allways a pain for me.
And even when i remembered what they asked me for it was a even bigger pain to dig through all the files to find the stuff they wanted.
